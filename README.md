## About This App

This Rails app is about bands of the 1990's. Users can view 2 lists, one of "good" bands from the 90's and the other of "bad" bands of the 90's. The app allows users to add new bands to each list and to edit information about bands that are already on the the lists (or to delete a band from either list)

## Technology

This app was created using Ruby on Rails.
